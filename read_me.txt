CURRENT STATUS OF BIKESHARE PROJECT

Whoever is reading this - I was unable to successfully get my bikeshare project to run correctly.  I am still trying to
get the missind data for user input and get it to count rows correctly.  So be patient - I am not sure I will be able to 
make it work for the rest of the Git Hub project.
